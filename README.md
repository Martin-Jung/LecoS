LecoS is a QGIS 3 plugin for landscape ecology analysis on raster and vector data.
It converts classified raster layers to numpy arrays, derives patches, and
calculates landscape metrics inspired by FRAGSTATS. The plugin also includes a
polygon overlay workflow, raster landscape modification tools, and Processing
algorithms for batch use.

Supported environment:
- QGIS 3.0 or newer
- Python 3 as bundled with QGIS
- NumPy
- SciPy for statistics and raster modification tools
- Pillow for polygon overlay tools
- nlmpy is optional and only required for neutral landscape model algorithms

Installation:
- Install or copy the plugin into the active QGIS profile plugin directory.
- Ensure the required Python packages are available in the same Python
	environment used by QGIS.
- Restart QGIS after installing missing dependencies.

Documentation:
- Processing help pages live in the sextante_info directory.
- Metric help pages live in the metric_info directory.

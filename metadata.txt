name=LecoS - Landscape Ecology Statistics
qgisMinimumVersion=2.0
description=Contains several analytical functions for land cover analysis
version=1.9.9
about=LecoS is based on metrics taken from FRAGSTATS: http://www.umass.edu/landeco/research/fragstats/fragstats.html Functions include the calculation of metrics on rasters and vector layers. A polygon overlay tool is also available to ease up computation. Additionally LecoS provides some functionalities to manipulate classified raster images.

	Version 1.9.7:
	- Make sure that the Processing algorithms are updating

	Version 1.9.6:
	- Mean patch distance removed for now
	- Implemented link to new NLMpy python library.
	    * Options to calculate Neutral Landscape Models if library is installed

	Version 1.9.5:
	- Attempt to fix bug of the mean patch distance metric

	Version 1.9.4:
	- Fixed errors with new Processing version QGIS-2.6

	Version 1.9.3:
	- Bug fixing within the vector overlay tool

	Version 1.9.2:
	- Little fixes to make LecoS ready for QGIS master dev
	- added a grouping vector field to the Batch Polygon Overlay tool
	- Selection of non-working polygon features now working

	Version 1.9.1:
	- Some bugs fixed and useability improved

	Version 1.9:
	- Added new tools to the Processing toolbox for use in complex models
		- Function to count Raster cells -> Output as table
		- Function to query raster values below a point layer
		- Function to intersect two landscape (raster) layers -> Output clipped raster
		- Function to creates a new random raster based on values from a statistical distribution -> Output raster
		- Function to conduct a Neighborhood analysis (analogous to r.neighbors. or Focal Statistics in ArcGis)
		- Function to conduct a connected component labeling of connected patches
		- Function to conduct ZonalStatistics based on two landscapes (ZonalStatistics with raster layers in ArcGIS)
	- Improved the overall documentation for the Processing Toolbox and created new simple icons
	- Fixed Bug: http://hub.qgis.org/issues/8810
	- Various small bugs fixed

	Version 1.8.2:
	- Small bug fixing (Processing interface not working)

	Version 1.8.1:
	- Update for the integration of SEXTANTE into QGIS (now called Processing)

	Version 1.8:
	- Updated for new QGIS 2.0 API

	Version 1.7.5:
	- SEXTANTE support!
	- Fixed bug with the overlay calculation of landscape metrics (included no-data values)

	Version 1.7.4:
	- Fixed Bug with the rasterUnitsPerPixel extraction for QGIS 1.9/2.0. Now raises a warning if cells are not square
	- Improved Input response

	Version 1.7.3:
	- Some Improvements with the mismatching shapes and extents -> now uses polygon extent instead of the whole shapefile
	- Fixed Error with the Shannon Equitability
	- Fixed Errors with Diversity indices and shapefile edits
	- Fixed Bug causing QGIS to crash -> http://hub.qgis.org/issues/7612
	- The Batchoverlay now displays the progress in the QGIS main window taskbar 

	Version 1.7.2:
	- Enabled the calculation of landscape statistics for vector layers
	- Replaced QMessageBoxes with QMessageBar messages if a newer QGIS version (>= 10900) is used
	- Removed the landscape diversity tool and merged options to calculate landscape diversity into the other toolset
	- Fixed some small bugs with the GreatestPatch - SmallestPatch Metric
	- Fixed some bugs with mismatching shapes and extents (maybe better solution in the future)

	Version 1.7.1:
	- Fixed the "Add Table to QGIS"-Bug on Windows systems
	- Enables the option to save Results in the overlaying vectors attribute table

	Version 1.7:
	- Added new metrics: Median patch area, Mean patch distance, Mean patch perimeter, Mean patch shape ratio
	- Fixed some small bugs with the landscape modifier
	- Recreated the Batch-overlay tool from scratch and added several new functionalities to it
	- Fixed a bug for Windows using old numpy / scipy version where the function "count_nonzero" was not available

	Version 1.6.1:
	- Implemented a check-routine for the landscape diversity module.
	- Removed the icons from the toolbar as the functions increase. SEXTANTE support will be coming to enable easy access to LecoS
	- Build hasattr and try-catch phrases around import modules
	- Fixed small bug with the polygon-overlay

	Version 1.6:
	- Added the landscape modifier and several function to LecoS

	Version 1.5.1:
	- Implemented a small try-catch routine for gdal driver related issues

	Version 1.5:
	- Small Fixes. Implemented some error catching routines

	Version 1.4.9:
	- Fixed Errors resulting from the QGIS API Changes

	Version 1.4:
	- Added the options to calculate the median, upper and lower quantile, the minimum and the maximum as well
	as the standard deviation from unclassified raster shapes in the polygon overlay tool

	Version 1.3:
	- Created the Polygon Landcover Overlay tool, which is capable of extracting values per polygon feature from 
	underlying raster shapes. Both classified and non-classified raster shapes are supported. 

	Version 1.2:
	- Switched to a object orientied programming style. However parts of the code are still extremely slow :-(
	- Added several new metrics including Total edge length, Edge Density, Landscape Division Index,
	Splitting Index and Effective Mesh Size

name=LecoS - Landscape Ecology Statistics
qgisMinimumVersion=3.0
description=Contains several analytical functions for land cover analysis
version=3.0.0
about=LecoS is based on metrics taken from FRAGSTATS: https://www.fragstats.org/ Functions include the calculation of metrics on rasters and vector layers. A polygon overlay tool is also available to ease up computation. Additionally LecoS provides some functionalities to manipulate classified raster images.
